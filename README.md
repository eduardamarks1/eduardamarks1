## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Eduarda Marques, an undergraduate Computer Science student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I'm currently engaged in a research project exploring matrix decomposition techniques and their novel applications in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, I lead the Command and Data Handling System (CDHS) team, part of the electronics subsystem at Minerva Aerospace, where we develop CubeSat technology.
